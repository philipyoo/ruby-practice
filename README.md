**Questions:**

- For 10-Temperature exercise, there is a section in the rspec file:
  ```
  describe "utility class methods" do
  
  end
  ```
  Not exactly sure what utility class methods are or what exactly they are asking for. If you're reading this and you know what to do in this section, please email me at [philipyoo10@gmail.com](mailto:philipyoo10@gmail.com)
